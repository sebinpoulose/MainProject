\lang1033\fs22 Mr. Pappachy A L, 57 year old gentleman presented in Pulmonary Medicine department with complaints of \lang16393\fs24 recurrent cough and sneez intermittent fever for 3 months\lang1033\fs22 . \fs24 Initially she was evaluated in OPD basis. Chest radiograph showed increased bronchovascular markings. He was treated with oral antibiotic (Amoxcillin and Azithromycin) and other supportive measures. But her symptoms worsened, hence he again presented in OPD. \kerning2\par
\pard\sa160\sl252\slmult1\kerning0 With this background he presented here. He was tachypneic and slightly hypoxic at presentation. He had \lang16393 recurrent cough and sneeze with intermittent fever for 3 months. \lang1033 His chest radiograph showed increased bronchovascular markings. He was admitted and treated with IV antibiotics (Meropenem and Doxycycline), antiviral (Fluvir), bronchodilators\b  \b0 and other supportive measures. His baseline blood investigation showed elevated ESR, IgE, CRP and sugar values. Echocardiogram was done which showed good LV systolic function, grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, EF - 60% and no evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension. Computed tomography of chest was done which showed two tiny left lung nodules, minimal scattered centrilobular tree in bud nodules in the left upper lobe of lung. The features were deemed to be secondary to infection. Spirometry revealed mild small airway dysfunction and DLCO was normal. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\kerning2 He improved with treatment, is stable at discharge and maintaining a saturation of 96% on room air. Pneumococcal vaccine was given at discharge. Influenza vaccine was not given due to non availablity.\lang16393\kerning0\par
