Computed tomography of chest was done which showed patchy consolidatory area in medial segment of RML with air bronchograms, subsegmental  collapse along with multiple centrilobular tree in bud branching nodules in RML and RLL, subcentimetric reactive mediastinal lymph nodes. \kerning2 Echocardiogram was done which revealed good LV systolic function (EF- 60%), grade I mitral valve prolapse, mild MR and no evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension. \lang1033\kerning0 Bronchoscopy was done which showed purulent secretions in bilateral bronchial segments; thorough lavage was done and BAL was sent for appropriate microbial investigations\lang16393\kerning2\par
