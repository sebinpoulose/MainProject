\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 RADIOLOGY\b0 :\b CT BRAIN (16/02/19)\lang1033\b0 :\f4 OBSERVATIONS:Well defined intraparenchymal hyperdense area with ( HU about 50 to 60) noted in right ganglio-capsular region measuring 4.6 x 2.8 x 4.3cms. There is surrounding vasogenic edema in the form of hypodensity. This is seen to cause mass effect in the form of compression of ipsilateral lateral ventricle with minimal midline shift of 3.5mm towards left side.There is extension of the hyperdensity to the ipsilateral lateral ventricle and minimally into third ventricle.Chronic lacunar infarct noted in left basal ganglia.Rest of the supra and infratentorial brain parenchyma shows normal attenuation.Remaining ventricles and sulcal spaces appear prominent.The fissures,sulci and basal cisterns also show proportionate ectasia.Gray - white matter differentiation maintained.No evidence of extra axial bleed .Posterior fossa structures appear normal.Skull vault appear normal.Normal density of venous sinuses.Mucosal thickening noted in bilateral ethmoidal sinuses - sinusitis.IMPRESSION:Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving right ganglio-capsular region with surrounding edema causing mass effect as described above with intraventricular extension.Mild diffuse age related neuroparenchymal atrophy.Chronic lacunar infarct in left basal ganglia.\lang9\b\f0\par
CT BRAIN (17/02/19)\lang1033\b0 :\f4 Previously noted right ganglio-capsular acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage has increased in size and now measures 6.5 x 4.3 x 5.4cms ( AP x TR x CC) Increase in surrounding edema noted.There is further increase in mass effect ( midline shift now measures 8.5mm towards left side).There is further increase in intraventricular extension ( now into left lateral ventricle and fourth ventricle)Rest of the findings are in keeping with previous CT report.Advised follow up imaging and review.\lang16393\f0\par
\pard\lang9\b COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL\b0 :The patient was admitted to wards and was started on anti-epileptics, analgesics and anti edema measures.CT was done which showed large right sided intra cerebral bleeding with intraventricular extension.  He was managed conservatively and closely monitored.  Nephrology and Cardiology opinion was sought and orders were followed.The patient deteriorated later and had a GCS fall to E1M5VEt.  Repeat CT was done and which showed increase in the size of hematoma with midline shift and mass effect.  The treatment options including surgery and the risks involved in view of the large size of the bleed, chronic renal failure and others parameters and poor prognosis if the patient was explained to the patient party.How ever the patient party did not want surgery and opted for medical management.Hence he was further managed medically with anti epileptics and anti edema measures.  Nephrology review was given and  hemodialysis for the patient was planned.  Patient was started on dialysis and at around  1:30 am on 19/2/19 patient had tachycardia and high blood pressure, followed by sudden bradycardia, non recordable blood pressure and fully dilated and non reacting pupils. At 2 am on 19/02/2019 patient was declared expired and confirmed with ECG showing flat lines.\par
