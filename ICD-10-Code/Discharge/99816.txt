\ul\b COURSE IN HOSPITAL\lang16393\ulnone\b0\par
\pard\lang1033 Mr. P S Premachandran, 54 years old gentleman with no other comorbid illness presented in Pulmonary Medicine department with complaints of cough with blood stained sputum and breathing difficulty for 2 weeks. \kerning2 Initially he was admitted and evaluated in TATA hospital, Munnar. Chest X ray showed hyperinflated lung fields , \lang3081\kerning0 left basal mild haziness\lang1033\kerning2 . He was treated with IV antiiotics (Azithromycin) and other supportive measures. But he did not get any symptomatic relief, hence he was referred to Rajagiri hospital for further management. \par

\kerning0 With this background he presented here. His chest radiograph showed left lower zone haziness. He was admitted and treated with IV antibiotics (Piperacillin with Tazobactum and Doxycycline), bronchodilators and other supportive measures. He did not have any major episodes of hemoptysis after admission. His baseline blood investigations showed CRP and sugar values. Computed tomography with aortogram of chest was done which showed diffuse left lower lobe lung opacities (likely alveolar haemorrhage) with unremarkable bronchial and pulmonary vessels, small splenic lesion (likely hemangioma) with few small patchy areas of abnormal blush in right lobe of liver, (?telengiectasias), possibility of Hereditary hemorrhagic telengiectasias. Interventional radiologist (Dr. Manisha Joshi) opinion was taken for hemoptysis and advices were followed. Echocardiogram was done which revealed \lang16393\kerning2 good LV systolic function (EF- 60%) , grade I diastolic dysfunction and evidence of mild pulmonary artery hypertension. \lang1033\kerning0 Bronchoscopy was done which showed minimal mucoid secretions seen in bilateral bronchial segments, multiple telengectatic areas seen in trachea and bronchial tree, active bleeding was not seen; thorough lavage was done and BAL was sent for appropriate microbial investigations. Based on CT aortogram findings and bronchoscopic picture, he is suspected to have mild variant of hemorrhagic telengiectasias. He denies any history of nasal bleed or similar family history. The cause of bleed is deemed secondary to lower respiartory infection in abackground of telengiectasias.  He has been advised to be strictly complaint with medications, avoid strenuous exertion and to follow up in nearby hospital immediately if life threatening bout of hemoptysis occur. Ideally needs Neurology opinion for severe headache ,but relatives opted out due to social reasons .\par
