\lang1033\fs22 Mrs. Beeramma Moidheen, 80 year old lady known case of b\lang16393\fs24 ronchial Asthma and \lang1033\fs22 type 2 diabetes mellitus presented in Emergency Medicine department with complaints of\lang16393\fs24  cough and breathing difficulty for 1 day\lang1033\fs22 . \kerning2\fs24 Initially she was evaluated in a local hospital. But she did not got any symptomatic relief and hence she was referred to Rajagiri hospital for further management. \par
\kerning0 With this background she presented here. She was tachypneic and hypoxic at presentation. Her chest radiograph showed left lower zone patchy  infiltrates. She was admitted in Medical ICU under Pulmonary Medicine Department and treated with IV antibiotics (Piperacillin with Tazobactum and Doxycycline), bronchodilators and other supportive measures. \lang16393 Her baseline blood investigations showed elevated sugar values and features of diabetic ketoacidosis. Screening ECHO showed RA/RV normal and IVC collapsing. CT chest was done few plate atelectatic bands along the basal segments of both lower lobes and medial segment of right middle lobe. Minimal lef sided pleural thickening. \lang1033 Endocrinology opinion was taken and elevated blood sugars were managed. Spine surgery consultation was taken for back pain and advised x ray spine , which showed severe degenerative changes in lower lumbar spine with lumbar scoliosis. She was shifted to ward once ketoacidosis was corrected. \f1 She was enrolled in Pulmonary rehabilitation programme. \f0\par
\kerning2 She responded reasonably well to the treatment and is stable at discharge, maintaining a saturation of 94% on room air. \kerning0 Pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines were given at discharge.\lang16393\par
\lang1033\f1 The guarded outcome and grave nature of the disease with limitation in longevity has been explained to relatives.\par
