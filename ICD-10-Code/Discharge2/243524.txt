\ul\b COURSE IN HOSPITAL\par
\lang16393\ulnone\b0 Mr. Liby Thomas, 43 years old morbidly obese gentleman was evaluated in Neurology OPD (Dr. Kaushik) for bilateral leg swelling. Venous doppler was done which revealed right deep vein thrombosis. On evaluation by Cardiologist (Dr. Sandeep), he was found to have moderate pulmonary artery hypertension on echocardiogram. He was advised computed tomography of pulmonary angiography (CT PA). \par
With this background he presented in Pulmonary Medicine OPD. CT pulmonary angiography revealed pulmonary embolism. He was admitted under Pulmonary medicine care for further evaluation. Pulmonary function test showed moderate mixed ventilatory defect. Diffusion capacity showed mild limitation of diffusion. 22 channel sleep study was done, the report of which is awaited. Plan is to keep him on close clinical follow up from Cardiology and Pulmonology side. \par
Chances of potential worsening due to pulmonary embolism with obese habitius and probable sleep apnea has been counselled. \par
