\pard\sa160\sl252\slmult1\kerning2 Mrs. Ramla Rahim, 52 years old lady a known case of \lang1033\kerning0 bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis \lang16393\kerning2 presented in Emergency Medicine department with complaints of fever, cough and breathing difficulty for 2 days.\lang1033  \lang16393 Her chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation. She was admitted under Pulmonary Medicine department and treated \kerning0 with IV antibiotics (Piperacillin with Tazobactum and Doxycycline), antiviral (Fluvir), systemic steroids, bronchodilators and other supportive measures. \kerning2 Screening echocardiogram showed good LV function.\kerning0  Baseline blood investigations showed elevated total counts, ESR, CRP and sugar values. Computed tomography of chest was done which showed multiple centrilobular nodules with tree in bud pattern involving bilateral lung fields (R>L) with patchy consolidatory areas in right upper lobe along with small/reactive mediastinal lymph nodes, superadded bronchiolitis along the basal segments of both lower lobes, fibrosis with traction bronchiectasis and underlying subsegmental collapse involving right middle lobeand inferior lingula, few areas of mosaic attenuation in bilateral lung fields - likely secondary to chronic small airway disease. \kerning2 Cardiolgy consultation was taken for cardiac evaluation and adviced to do detailed echocardiogram\lang1033\kerning0  which showed good LV systolic function (LVEF 60%), grade I diastolic dysfunction and no evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension. Bronchoscopy was done which showed purulent secretions in bilateral bronchial segments; thorough lavage was done and BAL was sent for appropriate microbial investigations. \lang16393\kerning2\par
