She was on treatment under Pulmonary Department since 09-11-2015. She was on regular followup and was initiated on bronchodialators and other supportive measures. \kerning2\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\kerning0 With this background she presented here. She was tachypneic and hypoxic at presentation. Her chest radiograph showed bilateral lower zone haziness .  She was admitted under Pulmonary Medicine Department in Medical ICU and was initiated on non invasive ventilation. She was treated with IV antibiotics (Piperacillin with Tazobactum and Doxycycline), bronchodilators, systemic steroids and other supportive measures. Her baseline blood investigations showed elevated ESR, CRP, IgE, total counts and BNP. Cardiology opinion was taken for elevated BNP values and advices were followed. Screening ECHO was done showed adequate LV , normal RA/ RV and minimal B line. Gradually she got better with medications and was shifted to room with intermittent NIV support. \par
She is hemodynamically stable at discharge and is maintaining a saturation of 91% on 1 liter oxygen support via nasal cannula. Pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines were given at discharge..\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 The guarded outcome and grave nature of the disease with limitation in longevity has been explained to relatives. Chances of potential worsening and complications including worsening respiratory infection leading to respiratory failure and probable ICU admission in view of multiple comorbidities and poor pulmonary reserve has been communicated with relatives. \kerning2\par
