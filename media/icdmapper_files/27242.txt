\ulnone\b0\fs22 Mrs. Annakunge Varghese, 68 year old lady presented in Emergency Medicine department with complaints of fever, cough with expectoration and worsening breathing difficulty for 2 days. \kerning2\fs24 She is under treatment from Pulmonology since 17-08-2015. \kerning0 She was evaluated in OPD basis with chest x ray, Spirometry and 6 minute walk test. Chest radiograph showed increased bronchovascular markings. Spirometry showed moderate to severe obstruction. 6 minute walk test showed desaturation in previous study. She was initiated on inhalers and was kept  under regular follow up. \par
With this background she presented in OPD again with complaints of worsening cough and shortness of breath,  suggested admission, but patient opted out due to social reason. She was treated with oral antibiotics and other supportive measures. But her symptoms worsened, and hence she again presented in Emergency department . She was tachypenic and hypoxic at presentation. \kerning2\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\kerning0 She was admitted and treated with IV antibiotics (Imepenem and Doxycycline), bronchodilators, systemic steroid and other supportive measures. Her baseline blood investigations showed elevated CRP and sugar values. Computed tomography of chest was done which showed bilateral patchy consolidation and bilateral ground glass opacities (offocial report awaited). ECHO cardiogram was done which showed good LV systolic function (EF - 60%) and evidence of mild PAH. Cardiology consultation was done for tachycardia and advices were followed. Endocrinology consultation was taken for glycemic control and advices were followed. Antibiotic was hiked to Meropenem in view of persisting bronchospasm. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\kerning2 She is stable at discharge and is maintaining a saturation of 94% on room air. Pneumococcal vaccine was given at discharge. Influenza vaccine was not given due to non availablity.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\kerning0 The guarded outcome and grave nature of the disease with limitation in longevity has been explained to relatives.\par
