\pard\sb100\sa100 Mrs. Eliyamma Mathew, 77 years old lady a known case of systemic hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, old pulmonary tuberculosis and old cerebrovascular accident presented in Pulmonary Medicine OPD with complaints of cough and breathing difficulty. Her previous admission in Rajagiri hospital was in November 2015 with right upper lobe pneumonia. CT chest on 14-11-2015 showed partial resolution of consolidation with mediastinal mass lesion. Bronchoscopy was done at that time. BAL culture and sensitivity showed predominant growth candida species. She was on  regular follow up on OPD basis.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\lang1033 With this background she presented here. Her chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates. She was admitted and treated with IV antibiotics (Piperacillin with Tazobactum), antifungal (Candiforce), bronchodilators and other supportive measures. Her baseline blood investigation showed elevated sugar values. Echocardiogram showed m\lang16393\kerning2 ild concentric LVH, good LV systolic function (EF- 60%), grade I diastolic dysfunction, mitral annular calcification of PML and no evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension. Cardiology consultation was taken for high blood pressure and advices were followed. Endocrinology consultation was taken for glycemic control and advices were followed. \lang1033\kerning0 Computed tomography of chest was done which compared to previous HRCT on July 2016 showed no significant interval increase in size of right upper paramediastinal oval shaped lesion,mildly enlarged pre tracheal and sub carinal nodes which showed no significant interval increase in size,  right upper para mediastinal lesion shows no significant interval changes favouring benign etiology, bilateral multifocal bronchiectasis with intrabronchial contents, mild right apical fibrosis and few mediastinal lymphnodes. \lang16393\kerning2 Ideally she requires prolonged hospital stay and bronchoscopy for further management, but relatives opted out due to social reasons. In case of worsening in future plan is to do bronchoscopic evaluation. She was discharged at request. \lang1033\kerning0\par
\kerning2 She is stable at discharge and maintaining a saturation of 94% on room air. \lang16393\kerning0 Pneumococcal vaccine was given at previous admission. \lang1033\kerning2 Influenza vaccine was not given due to non availablity.\kerning0\ul\b\par
